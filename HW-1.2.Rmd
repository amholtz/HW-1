## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Mohamed Hussein
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 19 hours
* What gave you the most trouble: The weather problem- trying to figure out 
what conclusions I can make
* Any comments you have: I still am not sure exactly what data I was suppose
to make figures for. Especially for number 4. 





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

The box-and-whisker plot produced from the code below (Plot #01) portrays each 
season as a time interval. The y-axis shows the proportion of flights delayed on
each day, which are resembled by points. One can see the median for each season,
and can make the conclusion that one would tend to see the most delays of 
greater than 30 minutes in Spring 2011 and Summer 2011. In other words, 50% of 
the total number of days in the spring and 50% of the total number of days in 
the spring had the highest proportion of flights delayed more than 30 min. 50% 
of the total number of days in Fall 2011 had the lowest proportion of flights 
delayed more than 30 min and winter had the second lowest proportion. This means
that Fall 2011 tended to have the least amount of delays of greater than 30 
minutes. That being said, one can see the outliers in the fall, however this 
should not effect the overall conclusion. The outlier represent one particular 
day that had many delays. This could be due to a element independent from the 
season altogether such as logstics and holiday weekends, and therefore, should 
not affect the conclusion. It is important to understand the limitation of 
this figure. Fall could have many flights delayed by 29 minutes. Therefore, we 
cannot make the conclusion that Spring and Summer have MORE delayed flights than
Fall, but only that Spring and Summer have more flights delayed over 30 minutes 
than Fall 2011. In conclusion, if one wished to avoid delays of 30 minutes or 
more in 2011, one should have flown in the fall or the winter rather than the 
spring or summer.

## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

One looking to fly in older planes should fly with American Airlines, Delta 
Airlines, Envoy Air inc., and US Airlines. This is illustrated by the box-and-
whisker plot (Plot #02) created by the code below. The boxplot for each carrier 
depicts when the older 25%, 50%, and 75% of planes were made. The year 1980 is 
overlayed on this graph to resemble the deregulation of flights that occured in 
the late 1970s. The planes with the most legroom, should be those before 1980.*
According to the figure, American Airlines and Envoy Air have the most amount of
planes built before 1980. Since no airlines have medians below 1980, the 
airlines with the lowest medians should be favored by individuals wishing to 
fly on older planes, meaning airlines AA, DL, UA, MQ, US, and WN should be 
favored. They should avoid Airlines AS, B6, CO, EV, F9, OO, and YV. There are 
outliers that are below 1980, howeer, one would be careful selecting the airline
based off outliers, since they do not summarise the data set. For example, CO 
has two planes built well before 1980 as seen the plot. The median, however, for
CO's planes is in the 2000s. One cannot chose which plane they fly on when 
booked a flight. It is mostly chance, which plane they are seating on. They can 
only rely on probability. Therefore, those individuals have the greatest 
probability of securing a seat on a old plane if they fly with those airlines 
with the lowest medians (lowest meaning oldest). Lastly an important note, to 
make this plot, the flights that had 'na' for year of manufacture were removed.
It is possible that these planes were too old to have their year of manufacture
noted. It is not possible to determine the true age of these planes, so they 
were, therefore, removed from our plot. They are, nevertheless, still important
to note.

## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?

In order to answer this question, a bar plot (Plot #03) was made using each 
distinct flight number and matching the flight number to the destination airport
and state. From this bar plot, on can see that the number of flight numbers 
dedicated to flights to Texas dominated over the other states. The most common 
flied to states were those in the South and also resort or vacation states, such
as FL, LA, CA, and OK. Illinois was the 6th most common state that listed 
Southwest flights flew to. This is most likely due to Chicago. There are 31 
states that Delta does not fly to from Houston. PA, NJ, and AR are flied to less
than any other state that Delta does fly to from Houston. 

What is perhaps more shocking is the amount of flight numbers that were
assigned to multiple destination airports. For example, flight number WN167 is 
assigned to flights from Houston to MSY, DEN, and LAS. Although, MSY is the 
far more frequently flown destination airport to number WN167. DEN and LAS are
assigned to WN167 only once in 2011. This could have resulted from an error due 
to human mistake when imputting the data, but it could also be fact. If there 
was no WN167 flight to MSY that day, it is fair to assign that number to DEN. I
would, however, think this would cause confusion. Shockingly, WN167 is only one 
example of a common pattern in Delta flight number allocation. A second bar
plot was created (Plot #04) which shows the number (or count) of flight numbers
that were assigned one or more destination airports. In other words, since 
WN167 was assigned three destination cities, it contributes to the bar found
at 3 on the x-axis (There are 144 additional flights with 3 varying airport
destinations).

* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?

The bar plot made from all Southwest Airlines flights (Plot #05) appears very 
similar to the bar plot made in the first part of question 3. Again, Texas is 
the most flight to state in total for all flights leaving from Houston. These 
flights range from flights to Dallas to Austin. Second to Texas, Florida is 
found more than 10,000 flights below Texas. Texas as a destination, therefore, 
dominates the number of flights leaving Houston. Again, LA, and CA are the 
third and fourth most common destination states. Most of the states are the 
destination state between 2500 and 0 flights.

## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

To answer this question two different plots were designed. Prior to creating
plots, scatter plots for the weather variables including temp, precip, 
gust speed, wind speed, wind direction, dew point, humidiity, and visibility
were made against minutes delayed for each flight. The most telling scatter
plot was plotting the dew point (ºF) against the delayed time (min) (Plot #07).
This showed a positive relationship, meaning that the higher the dew point 
temperature became, the longer the delay became. Dew Point is defined as the 
temperature where condensation begins, or where the relative humidity would be 
100% if the air was cooled. This is way to measure moisture in the air. The 
higher the dew point temperature the more water vapor is in the air. Therefore, 
dew point is similar to humiditiy, and it relates to precipation. Days with high
dew point temperature could be relatively stormy or raining days. It is
important not to forget the magnitude of each point on the plot. The darker 
the circle, the more common that point is. The most common points are those 
between 60ºF and 80ºF, which also have the highest delays. Therefore, it is 
difficult to determine weather the flight delays are due to the dew point temp 
or if the delays are due to logistical or other weather problems that just 
happen to occur while dew point is relatively normal between 60 and 80ºF.

To further determine which weather patterns were associated with delayed flights
a box-and-whisker plot (Plot #08) was created to demonstrate the effects of each
conditionon the time of delay. The x-axis shows the log10 of the delay time 
(min) in order to ease viewing of the plots. At first glance, one can see that 
the medians from light freezing rain and freezing rain resulted in the longest 
flight log10-delays (min). Freezing rain can be quite problematic for a flight- 
especially for one in Houston, where freezing conditions are not common. 
Freezing conditions can cause problems with the runway, cleaning and water 
loading, and engines. The plane actually has to be sprayed to prevent freezing 
while the plane is in flight. In addition, inflight conditions could be 
effected, so waiting for the freezing rain to perhaps subside is a reason for 
increases delays. Looking back to the plot, one sees many outliers from 
scattered clods, partly cloudy, overcast, and mostly cloudy, as well as clear. 
The increase in delays on clear days is most likely due to factors external from
weather such as logistics and holiday breaks. The outliers in the cloudy 
conditions as well as the hazy condition could be a result of decreased 
visibility. It would be beneficial to cross reference the dates that resulted 
in outliers with the visibility data. Lastly, thunderstorms and rain also has an
increase in delay time. Thunderstorms and rain is severe weather, which make it 
hard to fly. 

It is important to mention that 'na' observations were removed from
the data. These values could contribute to a more defined conclusion, but they 
are not helpful when presenting the data in this example, since we have no
further information. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

Q4 <- 
  filter(flights, dep_delay>0) %>% 
  summarise(
    fourt_quantile = quantile(dep_delay, 0.75) 
  )

delay_time <- 
  
  select(flights,date,hour,dep_delay) %>%
  filter(dep_delay>=25) %>% 
  arrange(date, hour) %>% 
  group_by(date, hour) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay=mean(dep_delay))

weather_pattern <- 
  select(weather, date, hour, visibility, wind_speed, humidity, 
         dew_point, wind_dir, gust_speed, precip, conditions, temp) %>% 
  arrange(date, hour) 


weather_pattern_delay <- 
  full_join(delay_time, weather_pattern, by = c("date", "hour")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(avg_delay)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dew_point))


#Plot 06

## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

''
From the data given, the figure from the code below was made to illustrate the proportion of flights to four geographical regions for each carrier in the month of July. Airlines YV, FL, and AA fly only to states in the SOUTH, while the airline B6 flys only to the NORTHEAST, AS and F9 fly only to the WEST. B6 is Jetblue, who has its hub in New York City- they only fly to New York from Houston. AS is Alaskan Airlines, who only flys to Seattle from Houston, and F9 is Frontier Airlines which flys onto the Denver from House. The other airlines are a mixture of midwest, NE, south, and West. One can see trends. For example, the most flied to region is the South. The least flied region is the NE. The west is the second most flied to region, and the midwest is the third most. Geographically, this make sense. The South is the closest region to Texas, then the West, then midwest, and then the NE. The Northeast is the farther region to Texas. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

dest_carrier_date <- select(flights, date, dest, carrier) %>% 
  mutate(month(date)) %>% #adds new column with date variable
  filter(month(date)==7) #refines table to only data from July

airport_state <- select(airports, iata, state)

state_carrier_airport <- 
  left_join(dest_carrier_date, airport_state, by = c("dest" = "iata"))

state_carrier_airport <- 
  left_join(state_carrier_airport, states, by = "state") 

region_freq <- 
  
  count(state_carrier_airport, carrier, region) %>% 
  rename(Frequency = n) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region))

#Plot 08
g <- ggplot(data = region_freq, aes(x= carrier, y = Frequency, fill = region))
  
g + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") +
  coord_flip() + xlab("Airline") + 
  ggtitle("Plot #08 \n Proportion of Flights to 4 regions by airline in the month of July")
